# HEYTEA-Boston-Consumer-Insights-Analysis-
This study is based on survey data collected through Google Forms, comprising over 130 valid responses that cover key areas such as consumer purchasing habits, ordering preferences, in-store experience, and reactions to promotional strategies. After data cleaning and variable standardization, the dataset was divided into A/B groups following predefined rules. The notebook outputs indicate that both groups have balanced sample sizes (e.g., approximately 60+ respondents in Group A and 60+ in Group B), ensuring statistical reliability for A/B comparison. The dataset includes several essential behavioral variables—such as ordering method, satisfaction ratings, promotional information channels, and purchase frequency. Value_counts outputs further show that mobile ordering users account for a notable proportion, while satisfaction scores span the full 1–5 range, providing sufficient variation for evaluating differences in user experience.
